# ML
Machine learning algorithms

Currently there are two main networks in this work. One is LSTM (Long short term memory) and 2 SOM (self-organizing map). The general idea is to develop neural networks in the mathematical language of tensors and escape from the limitations of linear algebra and matrix calculus, in hope of allowing ML algorithms to handle more complex data.

The SOM is somewhat more complete, whereas LSTM lucks for now the training part. Note the LSTM network is a slight veriation of what has een proposed so far, it includes two 'memory line', with the aim what ever is not written in the one to be written in the other.

Also an Elman Recurrent network is included, purely for demonstration purposes, as to how RNNs flow and how real time on-line training might be conducted.

Also in the future the algorithms will be changed to run on GPUs as well.
